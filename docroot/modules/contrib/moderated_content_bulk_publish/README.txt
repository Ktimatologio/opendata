moderated content bulk publish

This module provides a bulk operation plugin for Publishing and Unpublishing moderated states from the admin/content page.
Also provides a bulk operation for pin and unpin (sticky/not sticky).
Also provides a language switcher for the admin-toolbar for available languages if site has more than one language.
